# 📘 DSA-CSharp

A comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) solutions implemented in C#.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository follows a structured branching model to maintain code organization and facilitate collaboration:

- **main** → Serves as the primary documentation hub and contains only the `README.md` file.
- **readme** → Contains documentation and updates related to the repository.
- **dev** → Acts as the working branch, containing all solution files and ongoing developments.
- **Feature-specific branches** → Each data structure has its own dedicated branch under `dev`:
  - **array** → Solutions for array-based problems.
  - **string** → Solutions for string manipulation problems.
  - **doublyll** → Implements doubly linked list operations.
  - **circularll** → Implements circular linked list operations.
  - **stack** → Implements stack data structure and related operations.
  - **queue** → Implements queue data structure and related operations.
