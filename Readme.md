📘 DSA-CSharp
A comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) solutions implemented in C#.

📂 Repository Structure
This repository follows a structured branching model to maintain code organization and facilitate collaboration:

main branch → Serves as the primary documentation hub and contains only the README.md file.
dev branch → Acts as the working branch, containing all solution files and ongoing developments.
Feature-specific branches → Each data structure has its own dedicated branch under dev:
arrays → Solutions for array-based problems.
strings → Solutions for string manipulation problems.
linked-lists → Implementations and challenges related to linked lists.
stack → Implements stack data structure and related operations.
queue-> Implements queue data structure and related operations.
